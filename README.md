## Features

### 1. **Incident Workflow**
- Custom workflow for managing incidents, including:
  - Automated email notifications upon ticket creation.
  - Predefined steps for ticket lifecycle: submission, categorization, resolution, and closure.
- Ensures efficiency and transparency in incident handling.

### 2. **Self-Service Portal**
- User-friendly interface for end-users to:
  - Log tickets.
  - Track the status of submitted tickets.
  - Search a knowledge base for common solutions.
- Designed to reduce the workload on IT staff by empowering users to resolve minor issues independently.

### 3. **Automated Notifications**
- Email notifications are sent to users at key stages:
  - Ticket creation: Confirms submission and provides ticket details.
  - Ticket resolution: Updates the user when the issue is resolved.
- Enhances communication and improves user satisfaction.

### 4. **Reporting Dashboard**
- A dynamic dashboard with widgets that track:
  - Open incidents by priority.
  - Average resolution time.
  - Tickets assigned to each team member.
  - Daily ticket closure rates.
- Provides actionable insights for IT managers.

### 5. **Incident Assignment Rules**
- Business rules automatically route incidents to the appropriate team based on:
  - Ticket category (e.g., network, hardware).
  - Ticket priority and urgency.
- Minimizes response time by ensuring tickets are assigned to the right personnel.
